# Introduction #

These error messages are classified in two categories: 'Format Type' (reporting format problems) and 'Logical Type' (reporting errors related to the logical relationships among the different sections in a file).

The validation messages have a unique identifier are classified in three levels: Info, Warn and Error. All of them come from the notational conventions included in the specification document. This way, all the rules in the specification which use "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED" as keywords, are defined at the Error level; the ones that use "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" as keywords are defined at the Warn level. Finally, others keywords such as "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL", are defined at the Info Level.

## Message List ##

| **Code**: | 1000 |
|:----------|:-----|
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | "{0}" MUST start with [MTD, PRH, PRT, PEH, PEP, PSH, PSM, SMH, SML, COM] |
| **Cause**: | Every line in an mzTab file MUST start with a three letter code identifying the type of line delimited by a Tab character. The three letter codes are as follows [MTD, PRH, PRT, PEH, PEP, PSH, PSM, SMH, SML, COM] |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1001 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | The number of Data line items is "{0}", whereas the number of header line items count is "{1}". They MUST be the same. |
| **Cause**: | The number of Data line items does not match with the number of Header line items. Normally, the user has not used the Unicode Horizontal Tab character (Unicode codepoint 0009) as the column delimiter, there is a file encoding error, or the user has not provided the definition of optional columns in the header line. |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1002 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | "{0}" value "{1}" is not a valid element name, which is given by indicating the number in square brackets. |
| **Cause**: | Indexed element structure like: element\_name[id](id.md)-element\_property. "[id](id.md)" and "-element\_property" are optional. |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1003 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | Optional Column "{0}" is not a valid abundance column format. |
| **Cause**: | Only protein, peptide and small molecule sections can allow to have abundance columns. The column name psm\_abundance\_XXX is not correct.. |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1004 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | Mandatory column "{0}" are required on the header line. |
| **Cause**: | Check the mandatory columns (e.g. header name). All column labels and field names are case-sensitive. The column delimiter is the Unicode Horizontal Tab character. |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1005 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | Optional column headers "{0}" are not allowed to be displayed in "{1}" line. |
| **Cause**: | Only following ms\_run optional columns allowed to be displayed in the header line: Protein header optional columns num\_psms\_ms\_run[1-n], num\_peptides\_distinct\_ms\_run[1-n], num\_peptides\_unique\_ms\_run[1-n], Peptide header optional column search\_engine\_score\_ms\_run[1-n] and Small molecule optional column search\_engine\_score\_ms\_run[1-n]. |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1007 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | Optional CV parameter column headers "{0}" format is not correct. |
| **Cause**: | Optional column headers MUST start with the prefix "opt_". Column names MUST only contain the following characters: 'A'-'Z', 'a'-'z', '0'-'9', '_', '-', '[', ']', and ':'. CV parameter accessions MAY be used for optional columns following the format: opt\_cv_{accession}_{parameter name}. {parameter\_name} can not set to 'null'. Spaces within the parameter's name MUST be replaced by '_'.  This is an optional column, and MAY be added at the right of the table._|
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1008 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | "{0}" should have three parts, which are split by a Tab char. |
| **Cause**: | MTD line including three parts, which are split by a Tab char. "MTD	{defineLabel}	{valueLabel}". Each of them should not be empty. |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1009 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | Metadata define label "{0}" can not be recognized. |
| **Cause**: | MTD defineLabel should include "{element}([{id}])-{property}", which is split by "-" char. |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1010 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | "{0}" value "{1}" should be 'Complete' or 'Summary'. |
| **Cause**: | The results included in an mzTab file can be reported in two ways: 'Complete' (when results for each assay/replicate are included) and 'Summary', when only the most representative results are reported. |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1011 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | "{0}" value "{1}" should be 'Identification' or 'Quantification'. |
| **Cause**: | The results included in an mzTab file MUST be flagged as 'Identification' or 'Quantification'  - the latter encompassing approaches that are quantification only or quantification and identification. |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1012 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | "{0}" value "{1}" is not a valid parameter. |
| **Cause**: | Parameters are always reported as [label, accession, name, value](CV.md). Any field that is not available MUST be left empty, except 'name'. mzTab makes use of CV parameters. As mzTab is expected to be used in several experimental environments where parameters might not yet be available for the generated scores etc., all parameters can either be reported as CV parameters, or by user parameters that only contain a name and a value. In the case when the name of the param contains commas, quotes MUST be added to avoid problems with the parsing: [label, accession, "first part of the param name , second part of the name", value]. |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1013 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | "{0}" value "{1}" is not a valid list of parameters. |
| **Cause**: | If multiple parameters are given for a given step, these should be separated by a "|". Parameters are always reported as [label, accession, name, value](CV.md). |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1014 |
| **Level**: | Error |
| **Original**: | "{0}" value "{1}" is not a valid publication. |
| **Cause**: | PubMed ids must be prefixed by "pubmed:", DOIs by "doi:". Multiple identifiers MUST be separated by "|". For example: "MTD  publication[1](1.md)  pubmed:21063943|doi:10.1007/978-1-60761-987-1\_6". |
|           |      |

| **Original**: | Column "{0}" value "{1}" is not a valid modification list. |
| **Cause**: | A comma delimited list of modifications found in the given protein/peptide/small molecule. Modifications or substitutions are modelled using a specific modification object with the following format: {position}{Parameter}-{Modification or Substitution identifier}|{neutral loss}. {position} is optional depending on the section where the modification is reported. {Parameter} is optional. It MAY be used to report a quantity e.g. a probability score associated with the modification or location. {neutral loss} is optional. Neutral losses are reported as cvParams. Neutral losses MAY be associated with certain modifications. In this case the neutral loss is reported after the modification object separated by the '|' character. Otherwise, they are reported in the same way that modification objects are (as separate, comma-separated objects in the modification column). |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 1024 |

| **Cause**: | Ambiguity of modification position MUST NOT be reported at the Protein level. |
|           |      |
|           |      |
| **Code**: | 2023 |
| **Level**: | Warn |
| **Original**: | "{0}" should be defined when assays are reported in the metadata section or if a PSM section is present in the file. |
| **Cause**: | If assays are reported or if a PSM section is present in the file, these attributes are MANDATORY, since back references to the MS run MUST be provided in certain sections. If the actual location of the MS run is unknown, a place holder value SHOULD be inserted. |
